Bing-Linux-Wallpaper
====================

This tool downloads wallpapers from Bing each day to set as wallpaper on your Linux computer.

I'm testing on my Ubuntu which is using Unity as an enviroment

#Usage

```
sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/bing_wallpaper.py" /usr/local/bin/bing_wallpaper
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bing_wallpaper
```

And from terminal you can call app by command

```
bing_wallpaper
```


And select some option via app context menu
